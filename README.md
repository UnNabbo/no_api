# No API
A Vulkan implementation/interpretation of Sebastian Aaltonen's blog post: ["No Graphics API"](https://www.sebastianaaltonen.com/blog/no-graphics-api) in the form of a RHI.
* TODO Api sections [8/9]
- [X] Modern GPU memory management
- [X] Command and queues 
- [X] Compute pipeline
- [X] Root arguments
- [X] Barriers and fences
- [X] Textures
- [X] Graphic pipeline
- [X] Render passes
- [ ] Mutable static Ccnstants
  - Impossibile without considerable overhead due to vulkan limitations on specialization constants, said that It could be implemented it in some hacky way tho.
